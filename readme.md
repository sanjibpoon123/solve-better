# Simple yet efficient

#### 1. Calculate amount of numbers divisible by a number (n) from range a to b where a < b (inclusively).
    
*This can be solved using the common `for` loop. However not so efficient as this one:*
        
```javascript
const result = (largeNum / n) - (smallNum - 1) / n
```
        
*Make sure the result returns an Integer.*
